    <h1 class="article-title">How do I download a file?</h1>
      <p>Downloading a file via BitTorrent is a simple three step process.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Install a BitTorrent client (several options to the right)</li>
        <li>Download and open a .torrent file in the client</li>
        <li>Wait</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The torrent tracker and client will work together to connect you to as many peers as possible. The client will download portions of the desired data from these peers and assemble them for you. Once you have all of the data the file will read 100% and you're all set.</p>

      <p>Most clients offer a way of creating a .torrent file and below are step by step instructions for doing so using qBitTorrent and using my simple torrent tracker.</p>
